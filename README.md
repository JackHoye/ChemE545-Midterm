Mission of the product is to train a machine learning model to predict the biodegradability of a plastic/material using information extracted from its SMILES string.
Portion (1) of the enclosed Jupyter Notebook imports the data from the Harvard Clean Energy Project DataBase (HCEPD) and extracts/saves information from the SMILES.
Portion (2) will train a simple linear regression ML model and test its accuracy.
Portion (3) uses similar architecture to train a polynomial regression model.

Work was completed as a team with Olivia Dotson managing portion (1), Christina Yang managing portion (2), and Jack Hoye managing portion (3).
