Supervised Machine Learning (SML) is an important tool that can take into account multiple attributes about a compound including its chemical structure and predict its biodegradability in the environment. SML models can help in figuring out which chemicals are going to be environment friendly helping in making responsible choices during chemical selection for different processes/products.\n",
